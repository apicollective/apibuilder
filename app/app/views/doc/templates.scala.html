    Templates are an experimental feature in API Builder's API.json format.
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href='@lib.Labels.ApiBuilderGitHubUrl/blob/main/examples/example-template.json'>Example api.json file demonstrating templates</a></li>
      <li> <a href='@util.fullUrl("/apicollective/example-template/latest#interface-statement")'>API Builder UI of this example</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Templates add support to api.json to create reusable definitions of
    the various features in API Builder. As of the initial release, templates
    are supported for both models and resources. Templates are syntactic sugar
    in the api.json file format that copy portions of common specs into multiple
    places. Templates require no changes in code generators (specifically because
    there are no template related changes in the service specification itself).
  </p>

  <p>
    The best way to understand templates is with an example. At Flow Commerce,
    we have APIs that surface account information to both our clients and to
    our partners. The accounts share a lot of common behavior - including fields
    and operations - but are exposed at different URLs (enabling caching
    and authorization based on how Flow's internal schemes).
  </p>

  <p>
    To implement the client and partner accounts, we wanted to define two models, eg
    (note this example is a simpler version of what we use at Flow but should highlight
    the strength of the templates feature).

    <pre>
      client_account:
        fields:
          - id: string
          - currency: string

      partner_account
        fields:
          - id: string
          - currency: string
    </pre>

    Then we expose each as a resource with a common set of operations:
    <pre>
      client_account:
        GET /client/accounts
        GET /client/accounts/:id

      partner_account:
        GET /partner/accounts
        GET /partner/accounts/:id
    </pre>

    In practice this leads to duplication in the api definition - and there is
    no good way to guarantee that the implementations stay consistent.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the templates feature, we instead define the common specs in a new
    top level node named "templates":

    <pre>
      "templates": {
        "models": {
          "account": {
            "fields": [
              { "name": "id", "type": "string", "example": "xxxx-1234" },
              { "name": "currency", "type": "string" }
            ]
          },
          "resources": {
            "account": {
              "operations": [
                {
                  "method": "GET",
                  "parameters": [
                    { "name": "id", "type": "[string]", "required": false, "maximum": 100 }
                  ],
                  "responses": {
                    "200": { "type": "[account]" },
                    "401": { "type": "unit" },
                    "404": { "type": "unit" }
                  }
                },
                {
                  "method": "GET",
                  "path": "/:id",
                  "responses": {
                    "200": { "type": "account" },
                    "401": { "type": "unit" },
                    "404": { "type": "unit" }
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    With this template, we can now define our two models. Note that these models will contain
    ALL of the data specified in the template - including all of the fields. Additionally, API Builder 
    automatically adds an interface named "account" with each model extending that interface.
    Model template declarations pull from the <em>templates/models/&lt;name&gt;</em> nodes in the
    api json specification.
    <pre>
      "models": {
        "partner_account": {
          "templates": [{ "name": "account" }]
        },
        "client_account": {
          "templates": [{ "name": "account" }]
        }
      }
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    We can now expose these models as resources, referencing the template for all the common operations.
    Resource template declarations pull from the <em>templates/resources/&lt;name&gt;</em> nodes in the
    api json specification.
    <pre>
      "resources": {
        "partner_account": {
          "templates": [{ "name": "account" }],
          "path": "/partner/accounts"
        },
        "client_account": {
          "templates": [{ "name": "account" }],
          "path": "/client/accounts"
        }
      }
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    Importantly, the template operations are merge operations. Anything you specific in the model
    or resource definition takes precedence. For example, you can easily add a field to just
    the client_account model by simply adding the field to that model specification.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note also that any types that are specified only in the templates section will be specialized
    to the model or resource that is using that template. In the example here, the template resource
    operations refer to the type <em>account</em> - the actual service specifications will refer
     to the type <em>client_account</em> and <em>partner_account</em> respectively.
  </p>
