Overview
========

Designed to host API documentation for REST services. See spec/api.json for
description of the API. Code generators for various languages & frameworks are independent of this application. Official generators can be found in [apidoc-generators](https://github.com/mbryzek/apidoc-generator). 


Projects
============

There are several projects within the apidoc repo.

core
====

Contains shared code to parse an api.json file into case classes,
including validation on the document in a way that is friendly to
users.

api
===
apidoc REST service itself. See spec/api.json contains the description
of the API.

www
===
Actual UI for apidoc.

Generated Code
==============
The .apidoc file lists the specific targets which are generated by
apidoc. To regenerate code, clone github.com/mbryzek/apidoc-cli and

    bin/apidoc update

In development:

    APIDOC_API_URI="http://localhost:9001" /web/apidoc-cli/bin/apidoc update

Updating apidoc.me
==================

    script/upload

SBT
==========
Memory settings for SBT:

    exec java -Xms512M -Xmx2048M -XX:MaxPermSize=1G -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled \ 
      ${SBT_OPTS} -jar /usr/local/Cellar/sbt/0.13.5/libexec/sbt-launch.jar "$@"

Developing
==========

You'll need to get the api schema into your dev postgresql database; to do that:

    $ psql
    psql> CREATE DATABASE apidoc;

Create a web user with permissions to modify the new database.

    psql> CREATE ROLE web WITH LOGIN;
    psql> GRANT ALL ON DATABASE apidoc TO web;

Then you'll need to create the database schema using [schema evolution manager](https://github.com/mbryzek/schema-evolution-manager#installation)

    $ cd /web/apidoc/schema
    $ ./dev.rb

The application consists of a service on port 9001, and a web app on port 9000.

One way to do this is to run a screen session, and in one screen do:

    $ sbt
    sbt> project api
    sbt> run 9001

...then in another screen, do:

    $ sbt
    sbt> project www
    sbt> run

Goto http://localhost:9000 in your browser

If you want to run the standard code generators service locally you can clone it from [apidoc-generator](https://github.com/mbryzek/apidoc-generator)

    $ sbt
    sbt> project generator
    sbt> run 9002

Goto http://localhost:9002/generators in your browser

Now both should be running and able to talk to each other, and should recompile
in situ for a nice development experience.
