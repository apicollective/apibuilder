Overview
========

Designed to host API documentation for REST services. See
spec/apibuilder-api.json for description of the API. Code generators for various
languages & frameworks are independent of this application. Official
generators can be found in
[apibuilder-generators](https://github.com/apicollective/apibuilder-generator).


Projects
============

There are several projects within the apibuilder repo.

core
====

Contains shared code to parse an api.json file into case classes,
including validation on the document in a way that is friendly to
users.

api
===
apibuilder REST service itself. See spec/apibuilder-api.json contains the description
of the API.

www
===
Actual UI for apibuilder.

Generated Code
==============
The .apibuilder file lists the specific targets which are generated by
apibuilder. To regenerate code, clone github.com/apicollective/apibuilder-cli and

    bin/apibuilder update

In development:

    APIBUILDER_API_URI="http://localhost:9001" /web/apibuilder-cli/bin/apibuilder update

Updating apibuilder.me
==================

    script/upload

SBT
==========
Memory settings for SBT:

    exec java -Xms512M -Xmx2048M -XX:MaxPermSize=1G -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled \ 
      ${SBT_OPTS} -jar /usr/local/Cellar/sbt/0.13.5/libexec/sbt-launch.jar "$@"

Developing
==========

You'll need to run the postgresql database (version 9.5 or greater). Two options:

  1. docker run -d -p 5432:5432 flowcommerce/apibuilder-postgresql:latest

  2. run locally - see the project https://github.com/apicollective/apibuilder-postgresql

The application consists of a service on port 9001, and a web app on port 9000.

One way to do this is to run a screen session, and in one screen do:

    $ sbt
    sbt> project api
    sbt> run 9001

...then in another screen, do:

    $ sbt
    sbt> project www
    sbt> run

Goto http://localhost:9000 in your browser

If you want to run the standard code generators service locally you can clone it from [apibuilder-generator](https://github.com/apicollective/apibuilder-generator)

    $ sbt
    sbt> project generator
    sbt> run 9002

Goto http://localhost:9002/generators in your browser

Now both should be running and able to talk to each other, and should recompile
in situ for a nice development experience.
