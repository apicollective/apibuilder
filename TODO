add a description on Response

Add support for multiple input types:
  - next up is avro
  - consider support for swagger.json here
  - data model we want is:
    - version has an original source file which contains a type (enum
      of ApiJson, AvroIdl, SwaggerJson(future)) and content (text)
    - remove api.json from the UI and replace with source
    - Change core ServiceBuilder / InternalServiceForm to be in a
      package called apiJson. Main signature now is parse -> service
    Hopefully straightforward now given standardization on service.json

Add support for ning async client 1.9.10
  https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/blob/master/MIGRATION.md
    - Rename xxxParameter (add, set, get...) into xxxFormParam
    - Rename xxxQueryParameter (add, set, get...) into xxxQueryParam

Breaking changes:
  - Change 404s to be explicit

Generators:
  - Cache the generators

UX:

  - On adding watch, check subscription and offer the user to enable
    the relevant subscriptions if not subscribed

  - On service visibility - if service is public and org is NOT, add
    note that the service will not be visible until the org is made
    public.

Ability to diff two versions of a service, producing a human readable
output of the changes. Use this as the basis for determining backwards
incompatible changes.

Org level setting to enable semver versioning (default on)
  - prevent backwards incompatible changes once at major version 1

Email user when their membership request has been processed

Implement subscriptions.findAll authorization filter

Implement backwards compatibility layer - each new version of a
service should be automatically validated against the latest version
with the same major version number. Consider if we require semver
versioning or not.

Automate end to tests of generated clients. Currently client libraries
are tested offline and manually. Need to think through how testing
will work across mulitple platforms.
  
api.json: Support authentication, documentation
  
Swagger 2.0 was released in September 2014. Explore if swagger 2.0 can become the input spec for apidoc.
