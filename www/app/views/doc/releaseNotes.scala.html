<h3>0.5.33</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Date Type: New '@core.Datatype.DateIso8601Type.name' type
    introduced. In ruby clients, maps to a Date instance. In JVM
    clients, maps to an <code>org.joda.time.LocalDate</code>
    instance. See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/161'>Issue
    161</a></li>

    <li>Dates now Supported in paths. When specifing an API, instances
    of type date are now allowed in the HTTP Path. Previously, we
    restricted this particular type from path parameters as
    serialization is unclear; Serialization remains the responsibility
    of the service itself and thus apidoc will just document that the
    type is a
    date. See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/161'>Issue
    161</a></li>

    <li>UI refactored so that resources are hyperlinked to their
    underlying model; All models, even if mapped to resources, are now
    listed in the Models section of the UI of
    apidoc. See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/152'>Issue
    152</a></li>

    <li>When downloading a client for the 'latest' version of a
    service, the user agent will reflect the actual version downloaded
    (instead of 'latest')</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.5.29</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Play client: Move Traits out of client so they can be accessed
    directly. See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/158'>Issue
    158</a></li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.5.27</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Support for clients using Ning HTTP Async library and Play
    Json: This release introduces support for a new client library
    based
    on <a href="https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client">ning's
    http async library</a>. The only dependencies you will need are
    play-ws and com.ning.async-http-client version
    1.8.x. See <a href="https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/tree/master/client-tests/ning_1_8">ning
    1 8 sample project</a> for an example SBT project setup to use the
    ning clients.</li>

    <li>Refactor of play client libraries. Main change was to remove
    the GET, POST, PUT, etc. methods and replace with a single
    _executeRequest method that takes the method as its first
    parameter. We think this is a more readable implementation and
    more concise in the client. If you previously directly accessed
    these methods, you will need to update your code to call
    _executeRequest instead.</li>

    <li>Operation body now supports Arrays as a type.</li>

    <li>Organizations now have a visibility setting which controls
    whether or not the organization shows up in the public
    directory. Public services can still be accessed by direct URL
    regardless of the org setting.</li>

    <li>Removed experimental support for avro schemas (event based use
    case too different from REST services).</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.5.13</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Support for public services. Each service now has a settings
    section to allow you to control the visibility of a service. The
    options are: "Organization" (available only to members of your
    org) or "Public" (available to anybody). Public services are
    visible to all users - but still can only be modified by members
    of your organizaetion. The default for all existing services is
    unchanged (restricted to organization). When creating new services
    you can specify the visibility you desire. To change the
    visibility of a service, click 'Settings' in the left menu bar
    when viewing the service..</li>

    <li>Services can now be deleted - when viewing a service, click
    Settings in left menu then 'Delete this service' if you would like
    to remove a service.</li>

    <li>New test harness to be able to download accessible clients
    from production to ensure they continue to compile across
    different target platforms.</li>

    <li>Numerous small bug fixes and improvements</li>

  </ul>


<h3>0.5.4</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Headers are now supported in spec and generated clients via a
    top level 'headers' declaration. This enables the service author
    to describe what headers the service understands, including
    setting default values which will be automatically included in all
    requests made via the generated clients.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/pull/131'>PR
    131</a></li>

    <li>Improved documentation of api.json format -
    See <a href='/doc/apiJson'>apiJson</a></li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.5.0</h3>

  <ul>

    <li> Simple command line validation of api.json files! To validate
    a file, you can now use a public REST endpoint:

    <pre>curl -XPOST -d @@./api.json http://api.apidoc.me/validations</pre>
    </li>

    <li> Organization metadata now part of settings - To access, visit
    http://www.apidoc.me, click on your organization, click on
    settings, then click on Metadata. Currently we have one setting
    which is the package name to use for JVM based clients. This
    allows you to specify explicitly the package name for all
    generated clients.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/86'>Issue
    86</a></li>

    <li> Expand support for body to include primitive types and enums.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/139'>Issue
    139</a></li>

    <li> Play and ruby clients now use strong types for all parameters
    of type enum. Previously these were sent as Strings.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/127'>Issue
    127</a></li>

    <li> Add support to play and ruby clients for GET parameters that
    are lists - parameters are now sent as proper HTTP parameters. For
    example, a GET method with type "[id]" will now generate HTTP
    requests like /foo?id=1&id=2&... Note that as Play framework does
    not have native support for collections in its routes file, these
    parameters are explicitly excluded from the generated routes file
    - instead you will see a comment describing the additional
    parameter.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/139'>Issue
    139</a></li>

    <li> Better JSON validation around requiring JsObjects for things
    like models, enum, body, etc.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/138'>Issue 138</a>
    and <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/134'>Issue 134</a>
    for examples.
    </li>

    <li> Better error messages when explicitly speciying a 404
    response w/ a type.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/135'>Issue
    135</a>.
    </li>

  </ul>


<h3>0.4.71</h3>

  <ul>

    <li> Enums are now supported as first class elements in
    apidoc. This is a breaking change as the prior implementation
    (using an enum attribute on fields) is no longer supported. You
    will get a validation error message to help with
    migration. See <a href="/doc/apiJson">apiJson documentation</a>
    for notes on the new enum support.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/pull/131'>PR 131</a>
    </li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.68</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Play 2.2 client support (currently alpha). Main differences
    with Play 2.3 client related to a few package names that changed
    in play 2.3 and a runtime error if you attempt to use HTTP PATCH
    (play 2.2 does not support patch natively). If you need to access
    a service using patch, you can override the PATCH method in the
    generated client to implement your own PATCH method.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/pull/122'>PR 122</a>
    </li>

    <li>Bug fixed in encoding of path parameters - thanks Gary!
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/pull/120'>PR 120</a>
    </li>

    <li>Play client: FailedResponse class renamed to FailedRequest as
    it is actually the request that failed.</li>

    <li>User agents in client: All generated clients now provide a
    default user agent to identify the version of apidoc that
    generated the client as well as the specific org, service, and
    version of the service description used to generate the client.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/pull/116'>PR 116</a>
    </li>

    <li>Few bug fixes to make enum values more readable and to enable
    using the ruby client library both with objects as well as hashes (from
    json).
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/114'>Issue 114</a>,
    <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/117'>Issue 117</a>,
    and <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/issues/118'>Issue 118</a>
    </li>

</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.55</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>First class support for organization domains. Makes it
    possible to list org domains (e.g. gilt.com, giltcity.com) for
    auto association with org when new users
    register.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/pull/102'>PR 102</a>
    </li>

    <li>Ruby client: Improved support for date time objects (able to
    instantiate models with date times using Ruby's Time or DateTime
    classes, in addition to existing string support.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/pull/105'>PR 105</a>
    </li>

    <li>Avro: Add support for DataTime.
    See <a href='https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/pull/106'>PR 106</a>
    </li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.53</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Introduce support to generate Avro Schemas (thanks
    kscaldef!). There is a new code generation
    target <code>avro_schema</code> that generates AVRO JSON from the
    model definitions.</li>

    <li>Add support for domains in the API for organizations - this
    can be used to associate a new user with an organization
    automatically based on email domain. Currently only available in
    API - UI is coming in a future release.</li>

    <li>Add support for metadata in the API for organizations, with
    the first attribute of <code>package_name</code> that becomes
    available to code generators that need a fully qualified package
    name. Currently only available in API - UI is coming in a future
    release.</li>

    <li>API route added to GET /organizations/:guid</li>

    <li>Add 'body' information to online documentation.</li>

    <li>Expanded unit tests based on scala coverage plugin.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.50</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Introduce 'body' on operations. For operations that support
    posting data, you can now specify a 'body' for the JSON document
    instead of explicit parameters. The body parameter takes a single
    attribute - type - specifying the name of a model. Example:
    <pre>
  "resources": {
    "message": {
      "operations": [
        {
          "method": "POST",
	  "body": { "type": "message" }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
    </pre>

    Bodies and query parameters are now fully supported in the play
    2.3 client and the ruby client.
    </li>

    <li>Query parameter support for operations. When specifying a
    body, you can also specify additional query parameters for an
    operation. The parameters section of operations is now interpreted
    as being in the body by default, and if a 'body' element is
    provided, the parameters are expected to be sent as query
    parameters. If this works out in practice, we will likely
    formalize parameter location to enable specifying query parameters
    without specifying a location.</li>

    <li>Added date time helper for parsing date time query parameters
    in play framework routes file. Thanks to Gary Coady - see
    https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/pull/62</li>

    <li>Update ruby client to ensure enums are fully supported.</li>

<h3>0.4.47</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Validation added to verify that any path parameters refer to
    fields that are required (not possible to specify an optional path
    parameter).</li>

    <li>Path parameters now must be a string, uuid, or number -
    previously we accepted any datatype.</li>

    <li>Responses of type 204 and 304 cannot return a type - must be
    unit - datatypes do not make sense for these response types.</li>

    <li>We no longer accept response codes 404 or 5xx in any json
    specification. We found inconsistencies across different services
    with these types, making it difficult / impossible to create clean
    clients that behaved consistently. A 404 will automatically be
    handled in the play client for all GET requests, returning either
    None or Nil depending on whether the method returns a single
    instance or an array.</li>

    <li>Play 2.3 Client: Few implicits made private / renamed to avoid
    name conflicts when a user imports json implicits for multiple
    services.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug where ruby client was incorrectly dropping path
    after domain.</li>

    <li>Ruby client breaking change: Removed authorize method as
    signature only supported a single user. Preferred method is to
    instantiate the client direclty:
    <pre>
      Client.new(url, :authorization => Xyz::HttpClient::Authorization.basic(username, password=nil))
    </pre></li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.43</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Replace 'values' element with 'enum' to be compliant with JSON
    Schema.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.42</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Validate that if a response explicitly specifies a 404, that
    its type is Unit. This ensures that we can build friently clients
    in scala which can turn a 2xx/404 response into an Option which is
    much nicer to use when building apps with the client.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.41</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Validate that if a response explicitly specifies a 204, that
    its type is Unit. Previously we accepted api specifications that
    incorrectly specified a type.</li>

    <li> Add validation for path parameters - only strings, UUID, and
    number types are now supported in path parameters which keeps
    serialization simpler.</li>

    <li> Major refactoring of the play client. Highlights include:

    <ul>

      <li>Methods that can return a 404 are now handled as returning
      an Option. This means you do not need to catch errors to handle
      404s, instead matching on the response leading to much nicer
      client code.</li>

      <li>Introduced traits for all resource clients and methods to
      obtain an instance of the resource client. This should make it
      simple to mock the clients in tests.</li>

      <li>Nicer internal implementation of a number of helpers
      (e.g. generating query parameters, path parameters, etc.). Helps
      improve readability of the client code.</li>

      <li>Fix bug to fully specify package of DateTime class.</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.40</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Introduce support for new datatype map. For the initial release,
    both the keys and the values of the map must be String which we
    believe enables most of the necessary use-cases while minimizing
    complexity. Strings will natively serialize / deserialize from JSON
    making the generated clients much simpler to use.

    <pre>
    {
      "models": {
	"event": {
          "fields": [
            { "name": "tags", "type": "map" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>

    <p>
    This allows the user to pass in key/value pairs using a map.

    </li>

    <li>Introduce support for enums. Enums are specified by appending
    an enum element in the definition of the field. For example:

    <pre>
    {
      "models": {
	"event": {
          "fields": [
            { "name": "source", "type": "string", "enum": ["incident", "plan"] }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>

    There are a few constraints on enums:
    <ul>
        <li>The field type must be string</li>
        <li>The enum values must be valid names - Names must be alphanumeric and must
	start with a letter. Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _ characters. Main
        reason to restrict character space is to enable code generation tools to produce
	nice enum classes w/ valid symbols for each value.</li>
    </ul>

    </li>

    <li> Validation for path parameters - only strings, UUID, and
    number types are now supported in path parameters which keeps
    serialization simpler. Previously we were allowing specification
    of, for examples, dates as path parameters which we do not intend
    to support.
    </li>

  </ul>

}
