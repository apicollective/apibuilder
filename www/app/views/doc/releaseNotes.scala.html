<h3>0.8.0 - Feb 2015</h3>

<p>This is a big release - a number of significant new features, a few
breaking changes to increase the quality of the code generated
clients, and a large internal refactoring. The biggest new features
are support for union types and imports.</p>

<p><b>Breaking Changes</b><p>

  <ul>

    <li>We have replaced apiToken with auth in the Client
    signature. Users who were previously passing in an API token will
    need to update their code to base in an instance of
    Authorization.Basic instead. This lays the foundation to have
    standard support for more authentication methods.

    <pre>class Client(apiUrl: String, apiToken: scala.Option[String] = None)</pre>

    is now

    <pre>class Client(apiUrl: String, auth: scala.Option[com.gilt.apidoc.v0.Authorization] = None)</pre>

    In order to use a token, create an instace of basic authorization with:

    <pre>com.gilt.apidoc.v0.Authorization("token")</pre>

    <li>The scala code generators generate new package names:

    <ul>

      <li> We have replaced the code that converts a service name to a
      package name so that it is more consistent. The main change is
      that camelcased service names will now split into sub packages
      (so apidocSpec becomes apidoc.spec). We think this change makes
      the package names more approachable and consistent.</li>

      <li> Code generators automatically include the major version
      number of each service in the package names being generated. The
      main goal here is to enable future upgradability of a client
      application or a service - major version numbers should be
      incremented each time a backwards incompatible change is
      made. By including the major version number in the package name
      we simplify a portion of the upgrade path. Note that you can
      override this behavior by explicitly providing a namespace in
      the api.json file you upload to apidoc.</li>

    </ul>

    <li>Ruby code generated now uses the new namespace as part of the
    module name in ruby. If you prefer to use the original non nested
    namespace, you can include &nbsp;namespace&nbsp; as an attribute
    in the <a href="@routes.DocController.apiJson">api.json</a> file you upload.</li>
 
    <li>The scala method name geneators may generate new names in some
    cases. This is primarily a bug fix where in some cases the
    resource name was duplicated in the path name (e.g. in the play
    routes code generator). Example: "GET /:org/agenda-items"
    previously generated a method name
    &quot;getAgendaItemsByOrg&quot;. This version will generate the
    name &quot;getByOrg&quot; as we do a better job identifying
    resource names from paths.</li>

    <li>We renamed the error package to errors to match other package
    names. We also moved the FailedRequest class into the errors
    package.</li>

    <li>The FailedRequest exception is now simpler (no longer wraps
    the response object). This allows the failed request object to be
    serialized, cleaning up stack traces that were otherwise visible
    in logs/console.</li>

    <li>In the scala clients, for methods with both parameters and a
    body, we reordered the parameters so that they would be more
    natural to use. For example, required path parameters will now
    appear earlier in argument list. Parameters in the function list
    are now ordered by:

    <ol>
      <li> all required query / form parameters first</li>
      <li> the body, if present</li>
      <li> remaining parameters</li>
    </ol>

    <pre>
      def postByOrgKey(domain: com.gilt.apidoc.v0.models.Domain,
        orgKey: String
      )
    </pre>

    is now

    <pre>
      def postByOrgKey(
        orgKey: String,
        domain: com.gilt.apidoc.models.Domain
      )
    </pre>

    <li> The resources element in the api.json file must now be a
    Map. Up until this version, we continued to support the original
    format of the resources element being an array; this release fully
    removes this deprecated features.</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Major Features</b><p>
  <ul>

    <li> <a href="@routes.DocController.apiJson#union">Union types</a> -
    apidoc provides support for declaring your own union types
    (sometimes referred to as sum or algebraic types). The basic idea
    is that you can express that a particular variable is one of a
    known set of types. As an example, in an ecommerce system, you
    might want to accept orders from both registered users (people who
    actually have a username and password with your service) and also
    from guest users (e.g. people who have never visited your
    application before). One way to model this is to define two types,
    Registered User and Guest User, a single union type User that can
    be either a Registered User or a Guest User, and then to model
    your order as having a User.
    </p>
    <p>
      More detailed information, with specific examples of how to use
      union types using the play clients,
      see <a href="@routes.DocController.playUnionTypes">Play Union types</a>.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li> Nomenclature change - Services have been renamed to
    Applications. We found that it was becoming difficult to
    differentiate between an application, each of its versions, and
    the actual REST API (or service). More precisely: Organizations
    contain applications. Each application can contain one or more
    versions (users upload versions to apidoc).</li>

    <li> We have introduced a new concept of a Service which is a
    complete description of a REST service as described by
    apidoc. Users of apidoc upload api.json files that contain a
    specification of a REST API. apidoc converts the specification
    into a service description that we now call a
    &quot;Service&quot;. A Service is a full description of the REST
    API. The schema for a service can be found
    at <a href="#@lib.Util.ApidocSpecExample.docsUrl">@lib.Util.ApidocSpecExample.key</a>.</li>

    <li>Code generators have been moved out of the apidoc code
    repository and into a separate repository (a
    href="@lib.Util.GeneratorGitHubUrl">@lib.Util.GeneratorGitHubUrl</a>). Combined
    with the introduction of the service schema, we now have a much
    simpler interface to create code generators. Code generators are
    now esssentially functions that accept an instance of a service
    and return a string (actual code). For specific information on the
    API to create a code generator,
    see <a href="@lib.Util.ApidocGeneratorExample.docsUrl">@lib.Util.ApidocGeneratorExample.key</a>.</li>

    <li> Services now have a namespace as part of the service
    specification. When uploading new version of an application, we
    automatically create a namespace for each major version by
    following the format:

    <pre>
      [organization namespace].[formatted service name].[major version number]
    </pre>

    The service name is converted to a namespace by converting to
    lower case, under score separated (converting from camel case
    automatically), and then splitting on underscore. Thus for the
    organization namespace com.gilt, version 1 of an application named
    apidoc-spec will result in a namespace of com.gilt.apidoc.spec.v1.

    <ol>

      <li> apidoc now supports importing definitions from other
      services. The namespace is required in order to resolve a
      reference to a model or enum imported from another service. See
      notes <a href="#import">below on importing</a>.</li>

      <li> the namespace continues to be used in code generation,
      mapping to package names, for example, in scala code
      generators.</li>

    </ol>

    <a name="import"></a>
    <li> Imports</a>: You can now import schema
    definitions from other services into your project. In order to
    import definitions:

    <ol>

      <li> <a href="/docs/apiJson">Declare your imports</a> your
      api.json file by providing the full URI to each service.json
      specification you would like to include.</li>

      <li> To use a type from an imported service, reference that type
      using the fully qualified name for the type. For example, if the
      service you are importing has a namespace of
      &quot;com.gilt.apidoc.spec.v1&quot; and you want to use the type
      &quot;service&quot;, you would declare the type of your field as
      &quot;com.gilt.apidoc.spec.v1.service&quot;</li>

    </ol>

    The @lib.Util.ApidocGeneratorExample.key project uses imports as
    part of its declaration - the simplest way to get started is to
    look at
    the <a href="@lib.Util.ApidocGeneratorExample.originalJsonUrl">api.json</a>
    file for that service.

    </li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Other enhancements / changes</b><p>

  <ul>

    <li> You can now create and manage API tokens to programmatically
    access apidoc
    applications. Visit <a href="@routes.TokensController.index()">@routes.TokensController.index()</a>
    to manage tokens.</li>

    <li> We added JSON error handling in the play client. This means
    that you will get a much nicer error message if we are unable to
    parse the document (we use play json validation here and return
    the error messages to you via the exception).</li>

    <li> We also provide a much nicer error message when the service
    returns an HTTP status code that is not defined in the
    specification (a common mistake). This should make it much easier
    to identify these errors. The message will be similar to &quot;HTTP
    xxx: Unupported response code. Expected: 200, 409&quot;</li>

    <li> You can now edit your organization via the UI to change your
    organization key or namespace. Use with care as changing the
    namespace would change the package names in generated code for all
    services that rely on the default namespace.</li>

    <li> We renamed the organization &quot;package name&quot; setting
    as &quot;namespace&quot; and have made it required. The
    organization namespace is globally unique.</li>

    <li> Base url is now optional avoiding need to guess the url
    during initial development (before service is deployed)</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.7.39 - December 19, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li> Email subscriptions: You can now subscribe to a number of
    different email alerts including notification when services are
    created or updated, and as an org admin, whenever somebody
    requests to join your organization. We also added email
    verification - combined with organization level domains, today
    when a new user joins apidoc they will receive an email message to
    confirm their email. Upon confirming their email, if their email
    domain matches a domain that you've setup for your organization,
    that user will automatically become part of your organization.</li>

    <li> Watch your favorite services: You can now watch your favorite
    services. There is an email subscription to receive a notification
    whenever a service that you watch is updated.</li>

    <li> If you forget your password, there is now a password reset
    flow available in the UI.</li>

  </ul>


<h3>0.7.7 - Nov 19, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li> Ruby client models now have a copy method that can be used to
    create copies of the instances with changes to specific
    fields. Example:
    <pre>
      domain = Apidoc::Models::Domain.new(:name => "apidoc.me")
      puts domain.name
      => apidoc.me

      puts domain.copy(:name => "gilt.com").name
      => gilt.com
    </pre>

    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/212'>Issue
    212</a></li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.7.4 - Nov 18, 2014</h3>

  <p>This is a major release with over 150 individual commits! Main
  changes are support for community contributed generators and a
  revamp of the internal type system, providing much more consistency
  in how we parse types as well as support for Maps of any defined
  type.</p>

  <p>Major features</p>
  <ul>

    <li> <b>Support for map[Any defined type] (beta):</b> This release
    introduces expanded support for map types. You can now define a
    type as Map[xxx] where xxx can be a primitive, enum, or model
    defined in your service. Prior to this release, we only supported
    maps where the values were strings. Note that in all cases, the
    keys of the map must be strings to confirm to the JSON
    specification. This feature takes advantage of the existing JSON
    parsers in client libraries to serialize to/from maps using the
    standard serialization - e.g. serialization works as expected, and
    because we validate the type of the values in the map, we can
    guarantee that a proper serializer exists.</li>


    <li> <b>Support for community code generators (alpha):</b>
    Generators are now implemented as rest services, with a standard
    interface described in apidoc. Adding a generator requires two
    steps:

    <ol>

      <li> Create a service implementing
      the <a href="@lib.Util.ApidocGeneratorExample.docsUrl">@lib.Util.ApidocGeneratorExample.key
      API</a>.</li>

      <li>
      Visit <a href="@routes.Generators.index()">@routes.Generators.index()</a>
      and enter the URL of your service.</li>

    </ol>

    Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gheine">gheine</a> for this contribution!
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/914'>PR 194</a>
    and <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/216'>PR 216</a>.

  </ul>

  <p>Minor improvements / bug fixes</p>
  <ul>

    <li> Add support for a JSON 'object' as a primitive
    datatype. While usage is anticipated to be rare, there are a few
    common use-cases to be able to send arbitrary json objects. We've
    added support for the 'object' datatype as a primitive to support
    these cases. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/215'>Issue
    215</a></li>

    <li> Ruby client models support explicit JSON serialization - each
    model will now have a to_json method to make explicit how the
    client expects json to be
    generated. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/213'>Issue
    213</a></li>

    <li> Ruby client to_hash method now checks for nil, avoiding null
    pointer errors in some cases -
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/214'>Issue 214</a></li>

    <li> Remove scala.collection.Seq and replace with Seq -
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/204'>Issue 204</a></li>

    <li> Standardize parameter names in ruby
    client. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/203'>Issue
    203</a></li>

    <li> Enum value names now handle dots correctly,
    e.g. incidents.create will generate IncidentsCreate constant in
    the scala
    clients. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/199'>Issue
    199</a></li>

    <li> Fix bug in scala clients when an operation has multiple 2xx
    response codes. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/187'>Issue
    187</a></li>

    <li> Add validation for query parameters with models when there is
    a body present. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/172'>Issue
    172</a></li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.6.3 - Oct 9, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li> Added bindables to simplify strongly typed enums and dates in
    play routes file. See <a href="@routes.DocController.playRoutesFile">Play
    Routes</a></li>


    <li> Revised documentation, including getting started
    guid. See <a href="@routes.DocController.index">Introduction to
    apidoc</a>.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.5.42 - Oct 1, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li><a href="@routes.DocController.index">Improved documentation</a>, especially for new users!</li>

    <li>Code refactoring in apidoc itself - project is mature enough
    now that we were able to replace the internal models used to
    bootstrap apidoc with the apidoc generated models! Thanks
    gheine. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/176'>PR
    176</a></li>

    <li>Better pluralization using org.atteo.evo-inflector
    library. Model pluralization can always be explicitly specified in
    the api.json file, but this change expands the number of cases
    covered
    automatically. See </li>

    <li>Code generation targets are extensible internally. First step
    towards opening up a simple way for anybody to contribute
    generators based on the apidoc
    model. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/171'>PR
    171</a></li>

    <li>Number of smaller bug fixes</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.5.33 - Sep 23, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Date Type: New '@lib.Primitives.DateIso8601.toString' type
    introduced. In ruby clients, maps to a Date instance. In JVM
    clients, maps to an <code>org.joda.time.LocalDate</code>
    instance. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/161'>Issue
    161</a></li>

    <li>Dates now Supported in paths. When specifing an API, instances
    of type date are now allowed in the HTTP Path. Previously, we
    restricted this particular type from path parameters as
    serialization is unclear; Serialization remains the responsibility
    of the service itself and thus apidoc will just document that the
    type is a
    date. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/161'>Issue
    161</a></li>

    <li>UI refactored so that resources are hyperlinked to their
    underlying model; All models, even if mapped to resources, are now
    listed in the Models section of the UI of
    apidoc. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/152'>Issue
    152</a></li>

    <li>When downloading a client for the 'latest' version of a
    service, the user agent will reflect the actual version downloaded
    (instead of 'latest')</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.5.29 - Sep 19, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Play client: Move Traits out of client so they can be accessed
    directly. See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/158'>Issue
    158</a></li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.5.27 - Sep 16, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Support for clients using Ning HTTP Async library and Play
    Json: This release introduces support for a new client library
    based
    on <a href="https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client">ning's
    http async library</a>. The only dependencies you will need are
    play-ws and com.ning.async-http-client version
    1.8.x. See <a href="@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/tree/master/client-tests/ning_1_8">ning
    1 8 sample project</a> for an example SBT project setup to use the
    ning clients.</li>

    <li>Refactor of play client libraries. Main change was to remove
    the GET, POST, PUT, etc. methods and replace with a single
    _executeRequest method that takes the method as its first
    parameter. We think this is a more readable implementation and
    more concise in the client. If you previously directly accessed
    these methods, you will need to update your code to call
    _executeRequest instead.</li>

    <li>Operation body now supports Arrays as a type.</li>

    <li>Organizations now have a visibility setting which controls
    whether or not the organization shows up in the public
    directory. Public services can still be accessed by direct URL
    regardless of the org setting.</li>

    <li>Removed experimental support for avro schemas (event based use
    case too different from REST services).</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.5.13 - Aug 30, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Support for public services. Each service now has a settings
    section to allow you to control the visibility of a service. The
    options are: "Organization" (available only to members of your
    org) or "Public" (available to anybody). Public services are
    visible to all users - but still can only be modified by members
    of your organizaetion. The default for all existing services is
    unchanged (restricted to organization). When creating new services
    you can specify the visibility you desire. To change the
    visibility of a service, click 'Settings' in the left menu bar
    when viewing the service..</li>

    <li>Services can now be deleted - when viewing a service, click
    Settings in left menu then 'Delete this service' if you would like
    to remove a service.</li>

    <li>New test harness to be able to download accessible clients
    from production to ensure they continue to compile across
    different target platforms.</li>

    <li>Numerous small bug fixes and improvements</li>

  </ul>


<h3>0.5.4 - Aug 18, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Headers are now supported in spec and generated clients via a
    top level 'headers' declaration. This enables the service author
    to describe what headers the service understands, including
    setting default values which will be automatically included in all
    requests made via the generated clients.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/131'>PR
    131</a></li>

    <li>Improved documentation of api.json format -
    See <a href='@routes.DocController.apiJson'>apiJson</a></li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.5.0 - Aug 14, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li> Simple command line validation of api.json files! To validate
    a file, you can now use a public REST endpoint:

    <pre>curl -XPOST -d @@./api.json http://api.apidoc.me/validations</pre>
    </li>

    <li> Organization metadata now part of settings - To access, visit
    @lib.Util.Host, click on your organization, click on
    settings, then click on Metadata. Currently we have one setting
    which is the package name to use for JVM based clients. This
    allows you to specify explicitly the package name for all
    generated clients.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/86'>Issue
    86</a></li>

    <li> Expand support for body to include primitive types and enums.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/139'>Issue
    139</a></li>

    <li> Play and ruby clients now use strong types for all parameters
    of type enum. Previously these were sent as Strings.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/127'>Issue
    127</a></li>

    <li> Add support to play and ruby clients for GET parameters that
    are lists - parameters are now sent as proper HTTP parameters. For
    example, a GET method with type "[id]" will now generate HTTP
    requests like /foo?id=1&id=2&... Note that as Play framework does
    not have native support for collections in its routes file, these
    parameters are explicitly excluded from the generated routes file
    - instead you will see a comment describing the additional
    parameter.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/139'>Issue
    139</a></li>

    <li> Better JSON validation around requiring JsObjects for things
    like models, enum, body, etc.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/138'>Issue 138</a>
    and <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/134'>Issue 134</a>
    for examples.
    </li>

    <li> Better error messages when explicitly speciying a 404
    response w/ a type.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/135'>Issue
    135</a>.
    </li>

  </ul>


<h3>0.4.71 - Aug 13, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li> Enums are now supported as first class elements in
    apidoc. This is a breaking change as the prior implementation
    (using an enum attribute on fields) is no longer supported. You
    will get a validation error message to help with
    migration. See <a href="@routes.DocController.apiJson">apiJson documentation</a>
    for notes on the new enum support.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/131'>PR 131</a>
    </li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.68 - Aug 5, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Play 2.2 client support (currently alpha). Main differences
    with Play 2.3 client related to a few package names that changed
    in play 2.3 and a runtime error if you attempt to use HTTP PATCH
    (play 2.2 does not support patch natively). If you need to access
    a service using patch, you can override the PATCH method in the
    generated client to implement your own PATCH method.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/122'>PR 122</a>
    </li>

    <li>Bug fixed in encoding of path parameters - thanks Gary!
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/120'>PR 120</a>
    </li>

    <li>Play client: FailedResponse class renamed to FailedRequest as
    it is actually the request that failed.</li>

    <li>User agents in client: All generated clients now provide a
    default user agent to identify the version of apidoc that
    generated the client as well as the specific org, service, and
    version of the service description used to generate the client.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/116'>PR 116</a>
    </li>

    <li>Few bug fixes to make enum values more readable and to enable
    using the ruby client library both with objects as well as hashes (from
    json).
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/114'>Issue 114</a>,
    <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/117'>Issue 117</a>,
    and <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/issues/118'>Issue 118</a>
    </li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.55 - Jul 28, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>First class support for organization domains. Makes it
    possible to list org domains (e.g. gilt.com, giltcity.com) for
    auto association with org when new users
    register.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/102'>PR 102</a>
    </li>

    <li>Ruby client: Improved support for date time objects (able to
    instantiate models with date times using Ruby's Time or DateTime
    classes, in addition to existing string support.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/105'>PR 105</a>
    </li>

    <li>Avro: Add support for DataTime.
    See <a href='@lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/106'>PR 106</a>
    </li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.53 - Jul 22, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Introduce support to generate Avro Schemas (thanks
    kscaldef!). There is a new code generation
    target <code>avro_schema</code> that generates AVRO JSON from the
    model definitions.</li>

    <li>Add support for domains in the API for organizations - this
    can be used to associate a new user with an organization
    automatically based on email domain. Currently only available in
    API - UI is coming in a future release.</li>

    <li>Add support for metadata in the API for organizations, with
    the first attribute of <code>package_name</code> that becomes
    available to code generators that need a fully qualified package
    name. Currently only available in API - UI is coming in a future
    release.</li>

    <li>API route added to GET /organizations/:guid</li>

    <li>Add 'body' information to online documentation.</li>

    <li>Expanded unit tests based on scala coverage plugin.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.50 - Jul 17, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Introduce 'body' on operations. For operations that support
    posting data, you can now specify a 'body' for the JSON document
    instead of explicit parameters. The body parameter takes a single
    attribute - type - specifying the name of a model. Example:
    <pre>
  "resources": {
    "message": {
      "operations": [
        {
          "method": "POST",
	  "body": { "type": "message" }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
    </pre>

    Bodies and query parameters are now fully supported in the play
    2.3 client and the ruby client.
    </li>

    <li>Query parameter support for operations. When specifying a
    body, you can also specify additional query parameters for an
    operation. The parameters section of operations is now interpreted
    as being in the body by default, and if a 'body' element is
    provided, the parameters are expected to be sent as query
    parameters. If this works out in practice, we will likely
    formalize parameter location to enable specifying query parameters
    without specifying a location.</li>

    <li>Added date time helper for parsing date time query parameters
    in play framework routes file. Thanks to Gary Coady - see
    @lib.Util.GitHubUrl/pull/62</li>

    <li>Update ruby client to ensure enums are fully supported.</li>

<h3>0.4.47 - Jul 16, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Validation added to verify that any path parameters refer to
    fields that are required (not possible to specify an optional path
    parameter).</li>

    <li>Path parameters now must be a string, uuid, or number -
    previously we accepted any datatype.</li>

    <li>Responses of type 204 and 304 cannot return a type - must be
    unit - datatypes do not make sense for these response types.</li>

    <li>We no longer accept response codes 404 or 5xx in any json
    specification. We found inconsistencies across different services
    with these types, making it difficult / impossible to create clean
    clients that behaved consistently. A 404 will automatically be
    handled in the play client for all GET requests, returning either
    None or Nil depending on whether the method returns a single
    instance or an array.</li>

    <li>Play 2.3 Client: Few implicits made private / renamed to avoid
    name conflicts when a user imports json implicits for multiple
    services.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug where ruby client was incorrectly dropping path
    after domain.</li>

    <li>Ruby client breaking change: Removed authorize method as
    signature only supported a single user. Preferred method is to
    instantiate the client direclty:
    <pre>
      Client.new(url, :authorization => Xyz::HttpClient::Authorization.basic(username, password=nil))
    </pre></li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.43 - Jul 14, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Replace 'values' element with 'enum' to be compliant with JSON
    Schema.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.42 - Jul 14, 2014</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Validate that if a response explicitly specifies a 404, that
    its type is Unit. This ensures that we can build friently clients
    in scala which can turn a 2xx/404 response into an Option which is
    much nicer to use when building apps with the client.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.41 - Jul 12, 2014</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Validate that if a response explicitly specifies a 204, that
    its type is Unit. Previously we accepted api specifications that
    incorrectly specified a type.</li>

    <li> Add validation for path parameters - only strings, UUID, and
    number types are now supported in path parameters which keeps
    serialization simpler.</li>

    <li> Major refactoring of the play client. Highlights include:

    <ul>

      <li>Methods that can return a 404 are now handled as returning
      an Option. This means you do not need to catch errors to handle
      404s, instead matching on the response leading to much nicer
      client code.</li>

      <li>Introduced traits for all resource clients and methods to
      obtain an instance of the resource client. This should make it
      simple to mock the clients in tests.</li>

      <li>Nicer internal implementation of a number of helpers
      (e.g. generating query parameters, path parameters, etc.). Helps
      improve readability of the client code.</li>

      <li>Fix bug to fully specify package of DateTime class.</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.40 - Jul 9, 2014</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Introduce support for new datatype map. For the initial release,
    both the keys and the values of the map must be String which we
    believe enables most of the necessary use-cases while minimizing
    complexity. Strings will natively serialize / deserialize from JSON
    making the generated clients much simpler to use.

    <pre>
    {
      "models": {
	"event": {
          "fields": [
            { "name": "tags", "type": "map" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>

    <p>
    This allows the user to pass in key/value pairs using a map.

    </li>

    <li>Introduce support for enums. Enums are specified by appending
    an enum element in the definition of the field. For example:

    <pre>
    {
      "models": {
	"event": {
          "fields": [
            { "name": "source", "type": "string", "enum": ["incident", "plan"] }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>

    There are a few constraints on enums:
    <ul>
        <li>The field type must be string</li>
        <li>The enum values must be valid names - Names must be alphanumeric and must
	start with a letter. Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _ characters. Main
        reason to restrict character space is to enable code generation tools to produce
	nice enum classes w/ valid symbols for each value.</li>
    </ul>

    </li>

    <li> Validation for path parameters - only strings, UUID, and
    number types are now supported in path parameters which keeps
    serialization simpler. Previously we were allowing specification
    of, for examples, dates as path parameters which we do not intend
    to support.
    </li>

  </ul>

}
