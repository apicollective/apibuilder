  <p>
    There are a few very different foundational reasons for which
    teams choose API Builder as their tool of choice for API
    Management. We know there are a number of different tools
    available in the market; teams often use API Builder either as
    their only API tool or as a complementary tool to their existing
    solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here we've collected a list of the common reasons why teams adopt
    API Builder.
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li> <b>Very, very high quality generated clients</b>: Teams that
    use API Builder end up relying 100% on the generated clients -
    ie. the developers STOP writing and managing their own client SDKs
    freeing up time to focus on product improvements. In practice this
    is only possible because developers love to use the clients from
    API Builder. The reason this is possible is because API Builder
    focuses on end to end on only supporting features that ensure the
    client SDKs themselves can be high quality.</li>

    <li> <b>Resource centric</b>: API Builder is resource first -
    instead of defining an operation explicitly, you define resources
    and then expose operations on that resource. This is hugely
    important for today's technology landscape given the rise of other
    resource oriented tooling (e.g. graphQL) where having high quality
    metadata on available resources is a huge help.</li>

    <li> <b>Simple service specification</b>: API Builder at its core
    separates the notion of the input format (e.g. api.json, swagger,
    avro) from the service description (service.json). This is a huge
    advantage as regardless of input format, the service specification
    can be fully expanded and complete. This separation enables API
    Builder to easily accept new input formats AND makes it very easy
    to fully parse a service (just download the service spec and use
    directly). The service spec is verbose and complete - perfect for
    machines. (If you are familiar with CQRS you will recognize that
    pattern here.) </li>

    <li> <b>Simple input format</b>: The default <em>api.json</em>
    format is simple for humans to write. It is JSON, but more than
    that it is approachable by a novice and designed to be both simple
    and easy. There is no need to understand <em<$ref</em>
    or <em>oneOf</em> or other constructs which which new developers
    often struggle. Instead, developers can look at existing examples
    and very easily copy/modify for their new application.</li>

    <li> <b>Great validation</b>: When you upload a new version of an
    API, extensive validation checks are run to ensure the internal
    consistency of your API. These checks are among the most
    comphrensive you can find anywhere - ensuring that all types,
    names, etc are internally valid. The development of this
    validation is one of the key steps to ensuring that ultimately the
    generated clients themselves are very robust and simple - and it
    starts by catching inconsistencies when the API specification is
    defined.</li>

    <li> <b>Integrated tooling</b>: API Builder itself offers a
    comprehensive REST API (the entire @lib.Util.fullUrl("/") website
    runs on the API Builder API) which means it is simple to automate
    any tasks as needed into your developer workflows. Teams have even
    written linters that enforce naming standards and conventions in
    the API itself, running as part of their suites of continuous
    integration tests.  Note also the
    <a href="@lib.Util.ApibuilderCliGitHubUrl">simple to use CLI</a> -
    many teams never actually even use the user interface of API
    Builder on a daily basis given the completeness of the API and CLI
    tooking.</li>

    <li> <b>Easy to add code generators</b>: Code generators in API Builder
    are themselves REST services which accept a service description
    (in JSON) and essentially return a string. Teams often write their
    own code generators - even small disposable ones - to
    systematically solve problems in an automated fashion.</li>

    <li> <b>Testability of clients</b>: With generated mock clients built
    from the same interface definition, teams can rely on mocks when
    building automated tests - and further use the provided mock
    clients to override only the specific features needed for a given
    tests.</li>

    <li> <b>Multiple input formats</b> Teams are free to author their
    specifications in multiple IDLs (swagger, avro, etc.), and it is
    straightforward to introduce new input formats into API
    Builder.</li>

    <li> <b>First class support for union types</b>: Union types - a
    type that itself is constrained to be one of a known set of types
    - are first class and simple to use in API Builder. This is a
    powerful feature that enables developers to maintain simpler APIs
    by empowering them, for example, to create new types
    vs. continually adding optional fields to existing types.</li>

    <li> <b>Discovery</b>: Free hosting of all services at
    @lib.Util.fullUrl("/"), including both private and public projects
    makes service discovery easy within a company.</li>

    <li> <b>Versioning</b>: API Builder records every single change to
    every API - presenting a list of safe and potentially breaking
    changes. Teams often use these lists to include in their own
    release notes. For example, here is the history of changes to
    the <a href="/history?org=@lib.Util.ApibuilderApi.organizationKey&app=@lib.Util.ApibuilderApi.applicationKey">API
    Builder API itself</a>.</li>
  </ul>
