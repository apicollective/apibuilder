    will be prompted to first login or register.</p>

  <div class="panel-body">

    <p>A service in apidoc represents a full REST service. Each
    service is fully described in a single file. By convention, we
    name these files 'api.json' and store them in the root of the
    project that defines the server that implements the service
    (e.g. the root directory of your source repository).</p>

    <p>
      The easiest way to get started is download an example api.json
      file and then edit it -
      this <a href="@lib.Util.ApiDocExampleApiJsonUrl">api.json</a> file
      is the description of the REST API for apidoc itself.
    </p>

      When you are ready - Click &quot;@lib.Util.AddServiceText&quot;

    <p><a href="@routes.Organizations.create">Create an organization</a> then continue.</p>
