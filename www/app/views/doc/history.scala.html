  <p>

   This project is based on practical learnings from scaling the Gilt
   technology organization across code, people, teams, and
   practices. At the time we started on this project, Gilt had over
   100 active committers, a distributed micro services architecture
   with over 300 independent applications, and significant revenue and
   traffic.

  <p>

   We were reaching another pivot in our growth that required a new
   approach to handling the complexity of software development in
   order to continue to iterate and grow.

  </p>

  <p>

   One of the core principles that emerged is the notion of Schema
   First development; namely, that if the interface is truly critical,
   it is actually helpful in practice to define your API by hand as a
   first class artifact of software development.

  </p>

  <p>

   From this point, we started to explore what was available on the
   market, hand writing interfaces for a few systems we were actively
   building. We looked at protobufs, thrift, avro, swagger, apiary
   and others before identifying our key requirements:

   <ul>

    <li> JSON: HTTP/JSON is everywhere. By focusing on this standard,
    we can ensure that the tooling we provide is available to all web
    developers - seamlessly including native application, web, and
    backend developers.</li>

    <li> REST first: Specifically api.json starts with a list of
    resources instead of operations as we want to encourage the
    identification of REST resources as early as possible in the
    development process.</li>

    <li> Simple documentation: Upload a JSON file and you have
    documentation. We want documentation to be first class, simple and
    immediate. Using apidoc just for documentation is one of our core
    intended use cases.</li>

    <li> Simple and terse schema: We wanted a web developer to be able
    to learn the schema by looking at a few simple examples. We also
    are writing the JSON by hand and need it to be terse and
    clear.</li>

    <li> No code annotations: we found that too many annotations made
    it difficult to see the code. Especially in a micro-services
    environment, we want to keep our applications simple and
    pure.</li>

    <li> Compatibility with existing tools: We borrowed everything we
    could from other projects and thus where possible we adopted
    standards from existing work. We were heavily inspired by
    <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com">swagger</a> in particular.</li>

    <li> Incredibly nice clients w/ no dependencies - the developer
    experience using apidoc clients is amazing - we want developers to
    love apidoc clients so much they no longer want to write their own
    client libraries.</li>

   </ul>

  </p>
