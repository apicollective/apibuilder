  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">

    <p>An API Builder service represents a full REST service. Each service
    is fully described in a single file. By convention, we name these
    files 'api.json' and store them in the root of the project that
    defines the server implementing the service (e.g. the root
    directory of your source repository).</p>

    <p>
      The easiest way to get started is to download an example
      api.json file and then edit it.
      This <a href="@lib.Util.ApibuilderExample.originalJsonUrl">api.json</a>
      file is the description of the REST API for API Builder itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are ready, click &quot;@lib.Util.AddApplicationText&quot;
      (located in the upper-right corner of your organization's screen) to
      upload your api.json file.
    </p>

    <p>
      View the <a href="@routes.DocController.apiJson">specification
      of api.json</a> for detailed information on how to describe
      your service.

    <p>At this point, you should have some beautiful, API Builder generated
    documentation for your REST service. If you distribute the URL
    with the version number 'latest', you will always have a link to
    the most current version of your service.</p>
