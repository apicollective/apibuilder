  <p>

    Code generation of high quality client libraries to access
    services described in apidoc is one of our primary goals. Apidoc
    supports client generation in mulitple languages, and more can be
    added/contributed over time based on community interest.

  </p>

  <p>

    We spend a lot of time designing exactly how we want developers to
    interact with the client libraries, and our proud of how simple
    the current client libraries are to use and to read. A few
    specific goals:

    <ol>

      <li> <b>Minimal Dependencies</b>: Where possible, we prefer
      client libraries using native dependencies of web frameworks
      (e.g. clients for play framework that require zero additional
      dependencies). Where not possible, we take extra care to
      minimize the dependencies needed, and where needed, to use the
      most standard dependencies possible.</li>

      <li> <b>Readability</b>: Each client library is first written by
      hand. We then automate the generation of that hand written
      client. The goal is to make the generated client
      indistinguishable from a generated one. We will never reach
      100%, but today we believe we are already close.</li>

      <li> <b>Single File</b>: When you download a client from apidoc,
      you will download a single fully contained, fully functional
      file. This makes it simple to either drop the file directly into
      your project or to build a library with standard tooling to
      share the client.</li>

    </ol>
