    Generating the code for high-quality client libraries to access
    services described in apidoc is one of our primary goals. Apidoc
    supports client generation in mulitple languages, and depending on community interest 
    additional languages can be contributed over time.

    We spend a lot of time designing exactly how we want developers to
    interact with the client libraries, and are proud of how simple
    the current client libraries are to use and read. A few
    specific principles guiding our work:

    <ol>

      <li> <b>Minimal Dependencies</b>: Where possible, we prefer
      client libraries that use native dependencies of web frameworks
      (e.g. clients for Play Framework that require zero additional
      dependencies). Where impossible, we take extra care to
      minimize needed dependencies and to use the
      most standard dependencies possible.</li>

      <li> <b>Readability</b>: Each client library is first written by
      hand. We then automate the generation of that hand-written
      client. The goal is to make the generated client
      indistinguishable from a hand-written one. We will never reach
      100%, but we believe we are very close.</li>

      <li> <b>Single File</b>: When you download a client from apidoc,
      you will download one fully contained, fully functional
      file. This makes it simple to either drop the file directly into
      your project, or to build a library with the standard tooling necessary to
      share the client.</li>

    </ol>
