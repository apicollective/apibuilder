    <p>Fully describe your REST service in an intuitive json format -
    start by creating a service below or downloading
    an <a href="/gilt/api.json/api-doc/latest">example</a>.</p>

    <p>Very intuitive format that is simple to pick up - either from
    <a href="@routes.DocController.apiJson">online docs</a> or from user
    contributed <a href="@routes.Application.index()">public services</a>.</p>

    <p>
      Start by describing your models, and then map your models to
      resources exposing the specific operations you would like to
      make available.
    </p>

    <p>
      api.json is designed to guide developers to think carefully
      about their APIs, making it simple to create services that align
      to the REST standard. By favoring convention over configuration
      in a few key places - developers are more likely to create great
      REST APIs.

    <p>
      Download native client libraries with no (or almost no)
      dependencies. We take special care to make sure the client
      libraries are a pleasure to use.

    <p><b>Example from ruby:</b></p>
    <pre>
      client = MyService::Client.new("http://localhost:8000")

      organizations = client.organizations.get(:limit => 10, :offset => 0)
      organizations.each do |org|
        puts "Org %s is named %s" % [org.id, org.name]
      end

      neworg = client.organizations.post(:name => "My org")
      puts "Created new org named %s" % neworg.name
    </pre>

    <p><b>Example from scala:</b></p>
    <pre>
      val client = com.gilt.apidoc.Client.new("http://localhost:8000")

      val organizations = client.organizations.get(limit = Some(10), offset = Some(0))
      organizations.foreach { org =>
        println(s"Org ${org.name} is named ${org.id}")

      val neworg = client.organizations.post(name = "My org")
