    <p>Fully describe your REST service in an intuitive JSON format.

    <p>API Builder has a very intuitive format that is simple to learn from

      <a href="@routes.ApplicationController.index()">public services</a>.</p>

    <p>API Builder also has support for other input formats, including avro idl and swagger 2.0.</p>

    <p>
      Start by describing your models. Then map your models to
      resources that expose the specific operations you would like to
      make available.
    </p>

    <p>
      api.json is designed to guide developers to think carefully
      about their APIs, while making it easy to create services that align
      to the REST standard. By favoring convention over configuration
      in a few key places, it enables developers to create great
      REST APIs.

    <p>
      Download native client libraries with no (or almost no)
      dependencies. We take special care to make sure that the client
      libraries are a pleasure to use.

    <p><b>Example from Ruby:</b></p>
    <pre>
      client = MyService::Client.new("http://localhost:8000")

      organizations = client.organizations.get(:limit => 10, :offset => 0)
      organizations.each do |org|
        puts "Org %s is named %s" % [org.id, org.name]

      neworg = client.organizations.post(:name => "My org")
      puts "Created new org named %s" % neworg.name

    <p><b>Example from Scala:</b></p>
    <pre>
      val client = new io.apibuilder.api.v0.Client("http://localhost:8000")
